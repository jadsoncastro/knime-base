# Default configuration file for our file system integration tests.
#
# The purpose of this file (in source control) is to demonstrate  
# which properties each system under test needs in order to operate
# correctly.
#
# ***IMPORTANT***
# DO NOT push any user names or secrets to our source control!!!
#
# Best practice is to copy this file to any location on your disc 
# and make an environment variable named 'KNIME_FS_TEST_PROPERTIES'
# point to it. This file can be populated with your credentials for
# testing.
#
# This file should only be updated when a new file system has been 
# implemented or an existing one has been modified. Then the file 
# system specific properties should be listed and checked in to 
# source control with dummy values.

# To test only one specific file system uncomment and adapt this line
# test-fs = local
