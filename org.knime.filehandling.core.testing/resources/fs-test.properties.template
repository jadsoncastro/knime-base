# Default configuration file for our file system integration tests.
#
# The purpose of this file (in source control) demonstrates  
# which settings each file system needs. Note that not every file
# system requires settings.
#
# ***IMPORTANT***
# DO NOT push any user names or secrets to git!!!
#
# Best practice is to copy this file to any location on your disk 
# and make an environment variable named 'KNIME_FS_TEST_PROPERTIES'
# point to it. This file can be populated with your credentials for
# testing.
#
# This file should only be updated when a new file system has been 
# implemented or an existing one has been modified. Then the file 
# system specific properties should be listed and checked in to 
# source control with dummy values.
#


# Limits the integration tests to only one file system. The currently available file systems are:
#   local
#   knime-relative-workflow
#   knime-relative-mountpoint
#   amazon-s3
#   google-cs
#   microsoft-sharepoint
# test-fs = local
