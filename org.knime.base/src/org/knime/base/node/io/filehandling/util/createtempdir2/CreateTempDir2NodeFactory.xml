	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Creates a temporary directory upon execute and exposes
			its path
			as flow variable. This can be useful in (a) demo application
			where
			the
			actual path of the output is not all that relevant, e.g. the KNIME
			public
			workflow server and (b) KNIME WebPortal and quickform flows,
			where
			some data is written, which is later downloaded by means of,
			e.g. a web
			link. The directory is deleted upon closing the workflow.
			The node
			can be also
			configured in a way that the created temporary
			directory is deleted upon reset.
		</intro>
		<option name="Write to">
			Select a file system in which you want to store the file. There
			are
			four default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Local File System: Allows you to select a location in your local
					system.
				</li>
				<li>Relative to: Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
					relative to the workflow, mountpoint or node.
				</li>
				<li>Mountpoint: Allows you to choose a mountpoint. Whenever this is
					selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose from available
					mountpoints.
				</li>
			</ul>
			It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
			you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node
			by clicking the
			<b>...</b>
			in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
			<i>Add File System Connection port</i>
			.
			<br />
			Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to the
			reader node. The file system connection will then be shown in the
			drop down menu.
		</option>

		<option name="Folder">
			Enter a valid destination directory where the temporary directory
			will be created at. Depending on the selected file system this
			is
			either a directory path (used by
			<i>Local File System</i>
			,
			<i>Relative to</i>
			,
			<i>Mountpoint</i>
			options and custom file systems added by specific connector nodes) or
			a URL (used by
			<i>Custom URL</i>
			option).
			<br />
			A path usually starts with a slash (/) character and does not contain
			a protocol.
			You can also choose a previously selected file from
			the
			drop-down list, or select a destination from the
			&quot;Browse...&quot; dialog (browsing is not available for custom
			URLs).
		</option>
		<option name="Create parent directories if required">
			Select when the directories of the selected output
			location should be created if they do not already exist. If this
			option is unchecked, the node will fail if a directory does not
			exist.
		</option>

		<option name="Temp directory prefix">
			Name prefix of the temporary directory. It will be
			amended by some random
			number to ensure uniqueness.
		</option>
		<option name="Export path as (variable name)">
			The name of the exported variable denoting the
			actual path of the
			created temporary directory.
		</option>
		<option name="Delete temp directory on reset">
			Check this box to delete the directory and all its
			content when the node
			is reset.
		</option>
		<option name="More path variables">
			A list of additional variables that will be
			created by the node. Each
			variable
			will denote a path to a file (as
			opposed to a directory path), whereby
			the
			file name is given in the
			second (Filename) column
